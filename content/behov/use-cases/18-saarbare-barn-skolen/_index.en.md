## Brief Description

Input from the City of Oslo Education Agency (UDE), including insight work related to vulnerable children in school and cross-disciplinary follow-up, as well as insight work related to the Educational Psychology Service (PPT) and holistic pupil follow-up (school–PPT).

## The Current Problem

Today, the legal obligations of services and the rights of users are perceived to be in conflict with each other (e.g. the statutory duty of prevention and early intervention, holistic and coordinated follow-up, versus the right to privacy with its associated rules on information sharing). The legal provisions governing information sharing, confidentiality, and a user's independent age of consent also vary between services. There is a significant need for greater clarity and a simpler overview. Uncertainty does not produce good practice. Consent-based information sharing is an obvious and important prerequisite for good follow-up, but deficiencies in motivation, linguistic, cultural, and digital competence among users can be an obstacle to obtaining necessary consents. Consistent use of plain language – including multiple languages (text, audio, and images) and simple usability – is therefore essential.

## Key Insight Points

- A challenge with the cross-disciplinary collaboration tools that exist today (such as DIPS samspill, BTI stafettlogg, and others) is that access is tied to an individual (MinID), not to a role. This enables access across services and organisations, but prevents managers from being able to assign and reassign tasks, as well as approve them (functions that tools such as websak provide). The head teacher/principal is responsible for ensuring that measures and tasks belonging to their own institution are followed up, and that the statutory cross-disciplinary coordination is safeguarded. The head teacher/principal must therefore have the access rights necessary to maintain an overview, assign and reassign tasks, and grant approvals. Access and access management must be linked to roles, not only to individuals.
- Varying or insufficient knowledge within services about the possibilities and limitations of information sharing is currently one of the bottlenecks. A digital system that includes functions for simple legal guidance would be highly beneficial.

## Needs and Proposed Solutions

### Legal Guidance

Holistic pupil follow-up/pupil flow (school–PPT). The pre-project (school–PPT) has conducted extensive insight work to shed light on how we can create coherent services, smoother transitions, better data quality, and greater efficiency.

### Holistic Pupil Follow-Up (School–PPT)

Through the insight phase, we have developed a recommendation for what should underpin a new digital solution to support the joint work of schools and PPT in ensuring that pupils receive a satisfactory benefit from their education.

The objective is for the solution to contribute to:

- Better collaboration between schools, PPT, and guardians
- Increased efficiency and quality through shared data and standardised processes
- Secure access management and a clear, well-structured workflow

Schools, guardians, and various departments within PPT have participated actively in the work. We have maintained close dialogue to ensure that the solution delivers a holistic and coherent service. The result is a foundation that demonstrates opportunities to eliminate time-wasting tasks, improve management data, and strengthen the quality of pupil learning outcomes through closer and more seamless collaboration. The project deliverables may also form the basis for further work in other projects. Holistic pupil follow-up (school–PPT) can be used both during and after the process.
